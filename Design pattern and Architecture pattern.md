Design pattern:
In software engineering, the software design pattern is a general, re-usable solution to a commonly occuring problem within common context. It is not a design that can be transformed into a source.
It's not a programming language or some source code or finished design that can tranformed into machine code, it's a pattern that can be used to solve a common problem and that common problem had been dealt by programmers before us.
There are 3 types of design pattern:
1 - Creational design pattern
2 - Structral design pattern
3 - Behavioural design pattern
